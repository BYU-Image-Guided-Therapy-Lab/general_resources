# General Resources for MRI Lab

## GitHub Help

### Setting up your computer for Git

1. Get started with [this website](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/set-up-git) each time you use Git on a new computer. 

**NOTE**: It says to use HTTPS security, but SSH is better because it will not force you to put in a password every time you push changes to Git.

2. Ask the Web Master (seen on the Public page) to add you as a member of the GitHub Organization.

3. If you run into problems, ask a lab mate or look on the GitHub instructions online. An AI chatbot can also point you in the right direction.
